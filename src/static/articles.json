        "body": "A pregnant teenager, who disappeared before she was scheduled to be induced, and her boyfriend are believed to have been found dead Tuesday following a days-long search, police said.\n\nThe bodies of two people believed to be Savanah Nicole Soto, 18, and her boyfriend were found in a vehicle in San Antonio, San Antonio Police Chief Bill McManus told reporters Tuesday evening, calling the case \"very, very perplexing.\"\n\n\"Detectives right now are looking at this as a possible murder, but we don't know for sure,\" McManus said.\n\nThe two bodies were found in the boyfriend's vehicle and are believed to have been there for three to four days, McManus said. Their identities will be officially confirmed by the medical examiner, but they are believed to be Soto and her boyfriend, he said.\n\nThe chief was unable to confirm if the female victim was pregnant and said that would also be left to the medical examiner to determine.\n\nThe vehicle was found on the 5900 block of Danny Kaye Drive in northwest San Antonio, police said. McManus did not know who located it.\n\nSoto was last seen Friday afternoon in Leon Valley, according to the Texas Department of Public Safety. The agency issued a CLEAR Alert -- used to help law enforcement locate someone in imminent danger or whose disappearance is involuntary -- for Soto on Monday.\n\nThe pregnant teen had passed her delivery date which \"caused significant concern among her family members after missing an essential medical appointment,\" the Leon Valley Police Department said in a press release earlier on Tuesday.\n\nSoto's mother, Gloria Cordova, told San Antonio ABC affiliate KSAT that her daughter was scheduled to be induced at a hospital this past Saturday.\n\n\"When I called her all morning she wasn't answering, was going straight to voicemail,\" Cordova told the station. \"We went to the hospital anyways. She was a no-show, and that's when I called the cops.\"\n\nCordova said her daughter's home was clean and had been prepped for the baby's arrival.\n\n\"This is not like her,\" Cordova told KSAT. \"She was so excited to have this baby. The house was already baby-ready.\"\n\n\"There's no reason why she would just get up and go off and do that,\" she added.\n\nCordova said the family is already reeling after her son, Ethan, died last year. The 15-year-old was fatally shot at his home in San Antonio, police said.\n\n\"[Savanah] knows what I went through with Ethan, and I know she doesn't want me to go through this again,\" the mother told KSAT.\n\nAmid the search for her daughter, Cordova said she did not know where the father of the baby was either.\n\n\"I just want her home,\" Cordova said. \"I'm worried about the baby, if she's even had the baby, if she's in danger.\"\n\nThe Leon Valley Police Department said Tuesday morning that it was actively investigating Soto's disappearance and seeking additional witnesses and information.",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- An appellate court on Tuesday reversed a 2022 federal conviction against former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, ruling that he should not have been tried in Los Angeles. \n\nFortenberry was convicted in March 2022 on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser. He resigned his seat days later following pressure from congressional leaders and Nebraska\u2019s GOP governor.\n\nIn its Tuesday ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that the trial venue of Los Angeles was improper because Fortenberry made the false statements during interviews with federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and in his lawyer\u2019s office in Washington.\n\n\u201cFortenberry\u2019s convictions are reversed so that he may be retried, if at all, in a proper venue,\u201d the decision said.\n\nA federal jury in Los Angeles found the nine-term Republican guilty of concealing information and two counts of making false statements to authorities. He vowed to appeal from the courthouse steps.\n\nFortenberry and his wife, Celeste Fortenberry, praised the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision,\u201d Jeff Fortenberry said in a statement. \u201cCeleste and I would like to thank everyone who has stood by us and supported us with their kindness and friendship.\u201d\n\nThom Mrozek, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles, noted that the appellate court left a path open for future proceedings against Fortenberry.\n\n\u201cThe ruling does not preclude a retrial on the charges that then-Congressman Fortenberry made multiple false statements to federal agents,\" Mrozek said in a statement. \"We are evaluating potential next steps before deciding how best to move forward.\u201d\n\nPatricia Hartman, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, declined to comment on the ruling\u2019s potential impact for federal prosecutors in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment on matters where we don\u2019t have charges filed,\u201d she said in an email Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Nebraska did not immediately return a phone message.\n\nFortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent.\n\nAt trial, prosecutors presented recorded phone conversations in which Fortenberry was repeatedly warned that the contributions came from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent. The donations were funneled through three strawmen at the 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nThe case stemmed from an FBI investigation into $180,000 in illegal campaign contributions to four campaigns from Chagoury, who lived in Paris at the time. Chagoury admitted to the crime in 2019 and agreed to pay a $1.8 million fine.\n\nIt was the first trial of a sitting congressman since Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, was convicted of bribery and other felony charges in 2002.",

Shell Jr., is wanted on charges of premeditated first-degree murder and attempted premeditated first-degree murder, police said.\n\nA $10,000 reward is available for information leading to his arrest.\n\nThe slain victim, 40-year-old David Nathaniel Barron, was found dead in a common area of the mall when police arrived, authorities said. He is believed to have been the target, Ocala Police Chief Mike Balken said.\n\nA woman was shot and injured and taken to a hospital with non-life-threatening injuries, authorities said. Other injuries stemming from the incident included chest pains and a broken arm, Balken said.\n\nPolice issued a statement Sunday urging the person who took the suspect's red hat from the mall to come forward.\n\n\"That hat may contain valuable DNA evidence,\" police said. \"If you do not return the hat within the next few hours, we will release your picture ... and you will be arrested with a felony charge of tampering with evidence.\"\n\nThe mall, which was packed with shoppers ahead of the holiday, was evacuated after the gunfire broke out.\n\n\"This is the worst thing we can imagine right now at this time of the year,\" Balken said. \"Somebody has suffered a loss in their family. It's a horrible time of year for this to happen ever. It's especially sad during the holidays.\"\n\nSyriah Williams, 18, told ABC News she was shopping at Bath & Body Works with her mother when she heard several shots ring out and \"chaos erupted.\"\n\n\"The employees opened the back storage area and told everyone to run,\" said Williams, who took cover behind the counters at the store.\n\nOcala Gazette owner Jennifer Hunt Murty told ABC News Radio she was volunteering at a gift-wrapping station when gunfire erupted about 10 feet away from her.\n\n\"We dropped to the ground,\" she said. \"I texted the police chief and said active shooter in the mall, and he responded right away.\"\n\nShe said she texted the chief where the injured victims were so medics could get to them, and after it seemed safe began interviewing people and taking photos.\n\n\"You never know how you're going to react in those situations, but I went to work,\" she said.\n\nPolice recovered a gun from the scene believed to have been used in the shooting, Balken said.\n\nThe mall will be closed Sunday and Monday.\n\nABC News' Layla Ferris contributed to this report.",

        "body": "SPRINGFIELD, Ill. -- It was the dog, stuck atop skyscraping grain silos on Springfield's northeast side in 2019, that forced Chris Richmond's hand.\n\nThe stray had found its way to the top of the behemoth Pillsbury Mills, for decades a flour-churning engine of the central Illinois city's economy but now vacant more than 20 years. Rescue was too risky amid such decay, officials said. \n\nThe brief but precarious appearance by the dog, found dead at ground level days later after ingesting rat poison, represented the hopelessness posed by the vacant campus, Richmond recalled. \n\n\u201cThat's when I said, \u2018This is just unacceptable in our community,'\" said the 54-year-old retired city fire marshal, whose father's Pillsbury paycheck made him and his brother first-generation college graduates.\n\nA year later, Richmond and allies emerged with a nonprofit called Moving Pillsbury Forward and a five-year, $10 million plan to raze the century-old plant and renew the 18-acre (7.3-hectare) site. \n\nRichmond, the group's president and treasurer, vice president Polly Poskin and secretary Tony DelGiorno have $6 million in commitments and targets for collecting the balance.\n\nHaving already razed two structures, the group expects the wrecking ball to swing even more feverishly next year. Next door to a railyard with nationwide connections, they envision a light industrial future. \n\nMeanwhile, Moving Pillsbury Forward has managed to turn the decrepit site in Illinois\u2019 capital city into a leisure destination verging on cultural phenomenon. \n\nTours have been highly popular and repeated. Oral histories have emerged. Spray-paint vandals, boosted instead of busted, have become artists in residence for nighttime graffiti exhibitions, which more than 1,000 people attended. \n\nRetired University of Illinois archeologist Robert Mazrim has mined artifacts and assembled an \u201cEchoes of Pillsbury\u201d museum beneath a leaking loading dock roof. This month, the plant's towering headhouse is ablaze with holiday lights.\n\nPerhaps the exuberance with which Moving Pillsbury Forward approaches its task sets it apart. But in terms of activist groups pursuing such formidable reclamation aspirations, it\u2019s not unusual, said David Holmes, a Wisconsin-based environmental scientist and brownfields redevelopment consultant. \n\nGovernment funding has expanded to accommodate them. \n\n\u201cYou find some high-caliber organizations that are really focused on the areas with the biggest problems, these most-in-need neighborhoods,\u201d Holmes said. \u201cA lot of times, cities (local governments) are focused on their downtowns or whatever gets the mayor the ribbon cutting.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis-based Pillsbury built the Springfield campus in 1929 and expanded it several times through the 1950s. A bakery mix division after World War II turned out the world's first boxed cake mixes. \n\nThere is circumstantial evidence that the Pillsbury doughboy, the brand's seminal mascot, was first drawn by a Springfield plant manager who eschewed credit, not, as the company maintains, in a Chicago ad agency. \n\nPillsbury sold the plant in 1991 to Cargill, which departed a decade later. A scrap dealer ran afoul of the law with improper asbestos disposal in 2015, prompting a $3 million U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup. After the dog's cameo, Moving Pillsbury Forward persuaded the EPA to drop a lien for its cleanup costs and purchased the property for $1.\n\nNow, all that\u2019s left is to sweep up a the remaining asbestos and lead paint chips before pulling down more than 500,000 square feet (46,450 square meters) of factory, including a 242-foot (73.8-meter) headhouse that\u2019s the city\u2019s third-tallest structure and 160 silos, four abreast and standing 100 feet (30.5 meters).\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s daunting. Everything about this place is daunting,\u201d Richmond concedes. \u201cBut a journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step, right?\u201d\n\nThe timing is right. There is more money than ever available to mop up America's left-behinds, according to Holmes. \n\nThe 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act included $1.2 billion for brownfields cleanup, four times the typical annual allotment The Pillsbury group wants $2.6 million of the total added to what the group already has been promised by the federal, state and Springfield governments.\n\nThe application plays up the intangible benefits: economic and environmental justice availing the 12,000 people who live within 1 mile (1.61 kilometers) of the plant, only 25% of whom have a high school diploma and whose median household income is $25,000.\n\n\u201cIt's a tough sell but at some point, there are enough people who have a vision for what it could be that that's a powerful incentive,\u201d Poskin said. \u201cIt isn't going to be anything until what's there is gone. No developer is going to take on a $10 million cleanup job.\u201d\n\nThe group also set out to preserve memories of the place they are working to tear down. Ex-workers and neighbors have clamored for spots in ongoing tours and posed for group photos. \n\nIn a historical seniority list on display, next to \u201cJackson, Ernest, 1937,\u201d is the message, \u201cHi Grandpa. We are visiting your workplace of 42 yrs.\u201d Richmond and Mazrim have collected more than a dozen oral histories from past employees. Photographers are documenting what remains for historical context.\n\nAnd it's become an unlikely canvas. Minneapolis-based graffiti artists who tag their work \u201cShock\u201d and \u201cStatic\u201d were surreptitiously decorating the place in September when Richmond and Mazrim confronted them. Instead of pressing a trespassing charge, Richmond invited them to stage an exhibition. The nighttime November showing proved so popular that Richmond added a second date.\n\nArtist Eric Rieger, known to fans as HOTTEA, also took part, creating in a \u201ccathedral-like\u201d setting a huge, rectangular grid of black-light-lit neon strings of yarn suspended from the ceiling. His goal was \u201ca sense of really positive energy\u201d reminiscent of the fond memories employees experienced.\n\n\u201cThey were so enthusiastic and that\u2019s rare to find nowadays,\" Rieger said the night of the first exhibit Nov. 9. \"I really respect what they did for this community because they're the backbone of America \u2014 they were feeding America.\u201d\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press researcher Randy Herschaft in New York contributed.",

        "body": "ORLANDO, Fla. -- Disney has filed a lawsuit claiming that the oversight government for Walt Disney World, which was taken over by appointees of Gov. Ron DeSantis earlier this year, has failed to release documents and properly preserve records in violation of Florida public records law.\n\nDisney said in the lawsuit filed Friday that the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, often referred to as CFTOD, has been so slow in fulfilling its public records duties that it has failed to respond completely to a request the company made seven months ago when it paid more than $2,400 to get emails and text messages belonging to the five district board members appointed by DeSantis.\n\nDisney, DeSantis and the DeSantis appointees already are battling for control of the government in two pending lawsuits in federal and state court. \n\nThe public records lawsuit is asking a judge to review any documents that the district claims are exempt from being released, declare that the district is violating state public records law and order the district to release the documents that Disney has requested.\n\n\u201cCFTOD has prevented Disney from discovering the actions of its government through public records requests, in violation of Florida law,\u201d said the lawsuit filed in state court in Orlando. \u201cThe Court should grant Disney relief.\u201d\n\nAn email was sent to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District seeking comment.\n\nThe new lawsuit claims that the district is failing to follow public records laws in other ways, such as allowing the DeSantis-appointed board members to use personal email addresses and texts for district business without a process for making sure they are preserved and failing to make sure board members don't auto-delete messages dealing with district business.\n\nThe feud between DeSantis and Disney started last year after the company publicly opposed the state\u2019s so-called don\u2019t say gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. In retaliation, DeSantis and Republican legislators took over the district Disney had controlled for more than five decades and installed five board members loyal to the governor. \n\nAround 50 out of about 370 employees have left the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District since it was taken over in February, raising concerns that decades of institutional knowledge are departing with them, along with a reputation for a well-run government.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.",

        "body": "A federal judge in New York has ordered a vast unsealing of court documents in early 2024 that will make public the names of scores of Jeffrey Epstein's associates.\n\nThe documents are part of a settled civil lawsuit alleging Epstein's one-time paramour Ghislaine Maxwell facilitated the sexual abuse of Virginia Giuffre. Terms of the 2017 settlement were not disclosed.\n\nMaxwell is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence after she was convicted of sex trafficking and procuring girls for Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 in a Manhattan jail while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges.\n\nAnyone who did not successfully fight to keep their name out of the civil case could see their name become public -- including Epstein's victims, co-conspirators and innocent associates.\n\nJudge Loretta Preska set the release for Jan. 1, giving anyone who objects to their documents becoming public time to object. Her ruling, though, said that since some of the individuals have given media interviews their names should not stay private.\n\nThe documents may not make clear why a certain individual became associated with Giuffre's lawsuit, but more than 150 people are expected to be identified in hundreds of files that may expose more about Epstein's sex trafficking of women and girls in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands and elsewhere. Some of the names may simply have been included in depositions, email or legal documents.\n\nSome of the people have already been publicly associated with Epstein. For instance, Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz is publicly named in the judge's order. Certain minor victims will remain redacted.\n\nMaxwell, a longtime associate of Epstein, was convicted in 2021 of conspiring with Epstein to recruit, groom and abuse minors. In February, she asked the court to overturn her conviction and 20-year prison sentence.\n\nProsecutors subsequently urged a federal appeals court in June to uphold the conviction.\n\nFrom 1994 to 2004, Maxwell and Epstein worked together to identify girls, groom them and then entice them to travel and transport them to Epstein's properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, and elsewhere, prosecutors said. The girls -- some of whom were as young as 14 years old -- were then sexually abused, often under the guise of a \"massage,\" they said.\n\nGiuffre alleged in her lawsuit against Maxwell that Maxwell recruited her at the age of 16 to years of sexual servitude to Epstein. She also accused Maxwell and Epstein of directing her, between 2000 to 2002, to have sex with a number of their prominent associates, most famously Britain's Prince Andrew. The lawsuit was settled in May 2017, just before a trial was to begin.\n\nPrince Andrew had repeatedly denied the allegations and attacked Giuffre's credibility and motives. He agreed to settle a sexual assault lawsuit from Giuffre last year for an undisclosed sum.\n\n\"Prince Andrew has never intended to malign Ms. Giuffre's character, and he accepts that she has suffered both as an established victim of abuse and as a result of unfair public attacks,\" according to a letter filed from Giuffre's lawyer. \"It is known that Jeffrey Epstein trafficked countless young girls over many years. Prince Andrew regrets his association with Epstein, and commends the bravery of Ms. Giuffre and other survivors in standing up for themselves and others.\"",

The call was then determined to be a swatting attempt so the police response was canceled en route, Madden explained.\n\n\u201cWe determined before our personnel could get to her location that there was no emergency and there was no reason to respond,\u201d she said. \u201cHer security detail had it all under control, and there actually was nothing going on.\u201d\n\nThe congresswoman, who represents the cities of Rome, Dalton and Calhoun in northwest Georgia, spent her first term stripped of committee assignments by the former House Democratic majority over racist comments, her embrace of conspiracy theories and her past endorsement of violence against Democratic officials. She has since gained more influence under the House\u2019s current Republican leadership and continues to be a firebrand for the far-right.\n\nGreene's statement that she has been the target of roughly eight swatting attempts is accurate, Madden said. Past calls claimed that dead bodies had been found in the bathtub and in other areas of her home, which is located about 70 miles (113 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta. Police also responded last year to false reports of shootings outside her residence. \n\nThe department said it sent officers to the house in response to those prior incidents but has since formed a close working relationship with Greene's security detail, which allows officers to better assess the threat level. The criminal investigations division is working to identify Monday's caller and build a case, Madden said.\n\nAnother New York man was sentenced in August to three months in prison for making threatening phone calls to Greene's office in Washington, D.C.\n\nRepublican U.S. Rep. Brandon Williams said in a post on X that he was also targeted by a swatting attempt on Christmas Day. The Cayuga County Sheriff's office said it received a false report of a shooting at the congressman\u2019s home in central New York and sent officers to confirm that there was no present danger. Sheriff Brian Schenck did not immediately respond to phone messages seeking further details.\n\n\u201cOur home was swatted this afternoon,\u201d Williams wrote. \u201cThanks to the Deputies and Troopers who contacted me before arriving. They left with homemade cookies and spiced nuts! Merry Christmas everyone!\u201d",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- An appellate court on Tuesday reversed a 2022 federal conviction against former Rep. Jeff Fortenberry of Nebraska, ruling that he should not have been tried in Los Angeles. \n\nFortenberry was convicted in March 2022 on charges that he lied to federal authorities about an illegal $30,000 contribution to his campaign from a foreign billionaire at a 2016 Los Angeles fundraiser. He resigned his seat days later following pressure from congressional leaders and Nebraska\u2019s GOP governor.\n\nIn its Tuesday ruling, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit wrote that the trial venue of Los Angeles was improper because Fortenberry made the false statements during interviews with federal agents at his home in Lincoln, Nebraska, and in his lawyer\u2019s office in Washington.\n\n\u201cFortenberry\u2019s convictions are reversed so that he may be retried, if at all, in a proper venue,\u201d the decision said.\n\nA federal jury in Los Angeles found the nine-term Republican guilty of concealing information and two counts of making false statements to authorities. He vowed to appeal from the courthouse steps.\n\nFortenberry and his wife, Celeste Fortenberry, praised the court\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cWe are gratified by the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision,\u201d Jeff Fortenberry said in a statement. \u201cCeleste and I would like to thank everyone who has stood by us and supported us with their kindness and friendship.\u201d\n\nThom Mrozek, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Los Angeles, noted that the appellate court left a path open for future proceedings against Fortenberry.\n\n\u201cThe ruling does not preclude a retrial on the charges that then-Congressman Fortenberry made multiple false statements to federal agents,\" Mrozek said in a statement. \"We are evaluating potential next steps before deciding how best to move forward.\u201d\n\nPatricia Hartman, a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of Columbia, declined to comment on the ruling\u2019s potential impact for federal prosecutors in Washington.\n\n\u201cWe cannot comment on matters where we don\u2019t have charges filed,\u201d she said in an email Tuesday.\n\nA spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Nebraska did not immediately return a phone message.\n\nFortenberry was charged after denying to the FBI that he was aware he had received illicit funds from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent.\n\nAt trial, prosecutors presented recorded phone conversations in which Fortenberry was repeatedly warned that the contributions came from Gilbert Chagoury, a Nigerian billionaire of Lebanese descent. The donations were funneled through three strawmen at the 2016 fundraiser in Los Angeles.\n\nThe case stemmed from an FBI investigation into $180,000 in illegal campaign contributions to four campaigns from Chagoury, who lived in Paris at the time. Chagoury admitted to the crime in 2019 and agreed to pay a $1.8 million fine.\n\nIt was the first trial of a sitting congressman since Rep. Jim Traficant, D-Ohio, was convicted of bribery and other felony charges in 2002.",

Ron DeSantis earlier this year, has failed to release documents and properly preserve records in violation of Florida public records law.\n\nDisney said in the lawsuit filed Friday that the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District, often referred to as CFTOD, has been so slow in fulfilling its public records duties that it has failed to respond completely to a request the company made seven months ago when it paid more than $2,400 to get emails and text messages belonging to the five district board members appointed by DeSantis.\n\nDisney, DeSantis and the DeSantis appointees already are battling for control of the government in two pending lawsuits in federal and state court. \n\nThe public records lawsuit is asking a judge to review any documents that the district claims are exempt from being released, declare that the district is violating state public records law and order the district to release the documents that Disney has requested.\n\n\u201cCFTOD has prevented Disney from discovering the actions of its government through public records requests, in violation of Florida law,\u201d said the lawsuit filed in state court in Orlando. \u201cThe Court should grant Disney relief.\u201d\n\nAn email was sent to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District seeking comment.\n\nThe new lawsuit claims that the district is failing to follow public records laws in other ways, such as allowing the DeSantis-appointed board members to use personal email addresses and texts for district business without a process for making sure they are preserved and failing to make sure board members don't auto-delete messages dealing with district business.\n\nThe feud between DeSantis and Disney started last year after the company publicly opposed the state\u2019s so-called don\u2019t say gay law, which bans classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades. The law was championed by DeSantis, who is running for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination. In retaliation, DeSantis and Republican legislators took over the district Disney had controlled for more than five decades and installed five board members loyal to the governor. \n\nAround 50 out of about 370 employees have left the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District since it was taken over in February, raising concerns that decades of institutional knowledge are departing with them, along with a reputation for a well-run government.\n\n___\n\nFollow Mike Schneider on X, formerly known as Twitter: @MikeSchneiderAP.",

        "body": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 U.S. President Joe Biden ordered the United States military to carry out retaliatory airstrikes against Iranian-backed militia groups after three U.S. service members were injured in a drone attack in northern Iraq.\n\nNational Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said one of the U.S. troops suffered critical injuries in the attack that occurred earlier Monday. The Iranian-backed militia Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, under an umbrella of Iranian-backed militants, claimed credit for the attack that utilized a one-way attack drone.\n\nIraqi officials said that U.S. strikes targeting militia sites early Tuesday killed one militant and wounded 18. They came at a time of heightened fears of a regional spillover of the Israel-Hamas war. \n\nIran announced Monday that an Israeli strike on the outskirts of the Syrian capital of Damascus killed one of its top generals, Seyed Razi Mousavi, who had been a close companion of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, the former head of Iran\u2019s elite Quds Force. Soleimani was slain in a U.S. drone strike in Iraq in January 2020.\n\nIranian officials vowed revenge for the killing of Mousavi, but didn\u2019t immediately launch a retaliatory strike. The militia attack Monday in northern Iraq was launched prior to the strike in Syria that killed Mousavi.\n\n\n\n\nBiden, who was spending Christmas at the presidential retreat at Camp David, Maryland, was alerted to the attack by White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan shortly after it occurred Monday and ordered the Pentagon and his top national security aides to prepare response options to the attack on an air base used by American troops in Irbil.\n\nSullivan consulted with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Biden\u2019s deputy national security adviser, Jon Finer, was with the president at Camp David and convened top aides to review options, according to a U.S. official, who wasn\u2019t authorized to comment publicly and requested anonymity.\n\nWithin hours, Biden convened his national security team for a call in which Austin and Gen. CQ Brown, chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, briefed Biden on the response options. Biden opted to target three locations used by Kataib Hezbollah and affiliated groups, the official said.\n\nThe U.S. strikes were carried out at about 4:45 a.m. Tuesday in Iraq, less than 13 hours after the U.S. personnel were attacked. According to U.S. Central Command, the retaliatory strikes on the three sites \u201cdestroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of Kataib Hezbollah militants.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe President places no higher priority than the protection of American personnel serving in harm\u2019s way,\u201d Watson said. \u201cThe United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks continue.\u201d\n\nThe latest attack on U.S. troops follows months of escalating threats and actions against American forces in the region since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel that sparked the devastating war in Gaza. \n\nThe dangerous back-and-forth strikes have escalated since Iranian-backed militant groups under the umbrella group called the Islamic Resistance in Iraq and Syria began striking U.S. facilities Oct. 17, the date that a blast at a hospital in Gaza killed hundreds. Iranian-backed militias have carried out more than 100 attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria since the start of the Israel-Hamas war more than two months ago.\n\nIn November, U.S. fighter jets struck a Kataib Hezbollah operations center and command and control node, following a short-range ballistic missile attack on U.S. forces at Al-Assad Air Base in western Iraq. Iranian-backed militias also carried out a drone attack at the same air base in October, causing minor injuries.\n\nThe U.S. has also blamed Iran, which has funded and trained the Hamas group, for attacks by Yemen\u2019s Houthi militants against commercial and military vessels through a critical shipping choke point in the Red Sea.\n\nThe Biden administration has sought to prevent the Israel-Hamas war from spiraling into a wider regional conflict that either opens up new fronts of Israeli fighting or draws the U.S. in directly. The administration\u2019s measured response \u2014 where not every attempt on American troops has been met with a counterattack \u2014 has drawn criticism from Republicans. \n\nThe U.S. has thousands of troops in Iraq training Iraqi forces and combating remnants of the Islamic State group, and hundreds in Syria, mostly on the counter-IS mission. They have come under dozens of attacks, though as yet none fatal, since the war began on Oct. 7, with the U.S. attributing responsibility to Iran-backed groups.\n\n\u201cWhile we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our people and our facilities,\u201d Austin said in a statement.\n\nThe clashes put the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani in a delicate position. He came to power in 2022 with the backing of a coalition of Iranian-backed parties, some of which are associated with the same militias launching the attacks on U.S. bases.\n\nA group of Iranian-backed militias known as the Popular Mobilization Forces were key in the fight against Islamic State militants after the extremist group overran much of Iraq in 2014. The PMF is officially under the command of the Iraqi army, but in practice the militias operate independently.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Sudani condemned both the militia attack in Irbil and the U.S. response.\n\nAttacks on \u201cforeign diplomatic mission headquarters and sites hosting military advisers from friendly nations \u2026 infringe upon Iraq\u2019s sovereignty and are deemed unacceptable under any circumstances,\u201d the statement said.\n\nHowever, it added that that the retaliatory strikes by the U.S. on \u201cIraqi military sites\u201d \u2014 referring to the militia \u2014 \u201cconstitute a clear hostile act.\u201d Sudani said some of those injured in the strikes were civilians.\n\nQassim Abdul-Zahra reported from Baghdad.",

He wants to help his mother escape that fate.\n\n\u201cI just want to see my mother again, that\u2019s the goal,\u201d said Sckak, a university student in Sunnyvale, California. The 25-year-old is one of the Palestinian couple\u2019s three American sons, including an active-duty U.S. soldier serving in South Korea. \u201cBeing able to hold her again. I can\u2019t bear to lose her.\u201d \n\nHis mother, Zahra Sckak, 44, was holed up Saturday with an older, ailing American relative in a Gaza City building along with 100 others. She is among what the State Department says are 300 American citizens, permanent legal residents or their parents and young children still trapped by the fighting between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza.\n\nRelatives in the United States and other advocates are pleading for the Biden administration and Congress to help them flee.\n\nGaza\u2019s Health Ministry has reported more than 20,000 deaths in the fighting and more than 53,600 wounded. According to the United Nations, more than a half-million people are starving in Gaza because of the war.\n\n\n\n\nFadi Sckak\u2019s mother was on her sixth day with only water from the sewers to drink and with little or no food and rescue hopes waning, he said. His dad, Abedalla, was shot and wounded last month, after a bombing forced the family to flee the building where they had been sheltering, and died days later without treatment, he said.\n\nTheir son had listened over the phone as his mother begged for help after the shooting. He could hear his 56-year-old father, who had diabetes and corresponding health problems, in the background, crying out in pain.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t deserve a painful experience like that. To die, with no help, no one even trying to help,\u201d Sckak said. \n\nSome U.S. citizens and legal residents and their immediate family are stranded near Gaza\u2019s Rafah crossing into Egypt, desperately waiting for placement on a list of U.S.-government-provided names that would authorize them to leave Gaza. \n\nOthers, like Zahra Schkak, are trapped by fighting, and some are too ill or wounded to reach the crossing. They tell their families in voice messages and sporadic phone calls and texts of danger, hunger and fear.\n\n\u201cThis is the part of the missile that fall down on our heads yesterday,\u201d American citizen Borak Alagha, 18, texted his cousin, Yasmeen Elagha, a law student in Chicago, sending a photo of him holding a jagged chunk of metal.\n\n\u201cThis is the hole next to the place we are living now,\u201d Alagha said in another text. It showed a deep bomb crater next to their building near Khan Younis, where the family of 10 fled after Israeli officials identified the area as a safe place for civilians.\n\nYasmeen Elagha has reached out to State Department officials and members of a special task force. She has sued to force the U.S. government to do more after hearing from American officials that there is noting more they can do at the moment.\n\n\u201cThey are fully leaving them for dead,\u201d she said.\n\nThe State Department said Friday it has helped more than 1,300 people who were eligible for U.S. assistance \u2014 American citizens, green-card holders and their immediate family members \u2014 make it through the Rafah crossing to Egypt. The department is tracking 300 more still seeking U.S. help to escape; that includes what it says are fewer than 50 U.S. citizens.\n\n\u201cU.S. citizens and their families will make their own decisions and adjust their plans as this difficult situation changes,\u201d the department said in a statement.\n\nThe case of Sckak\u2019s family in Gaza has gotten more attention in Washington, given 24-year-old Ragi Sckak\u2019s Army duty in South Korea.\n\nRep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., said he has pushed the administration to get Americans out of Gaza. \u201cI know this is a top priority for the administration,\u201d he said in a statement, adding that U.S. officials would \u201cexhaust every option.\u201d\n\nMaria Kari is an immigration lawyer in Houston working on behalf of the stranded American citizens and legal residents. She points to the air and sea charters that the U.S. helped arrange to bring out more than 1,000 Americans and others from Israel after the Hamas attacks on Oct. 7 that started the war.\n\nShe has filed a lawsuit accusing the U.S. government of failing to protect Americans in danger abroad and unconstitutionally denying Palestinian Americans the kind of assistance it gave Israeli Americans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not asking them to do anything political here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re simply saying the State Department has a job. And it\u2019s not doing that job, for one class of citizens.\u201d",

        "body": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 Nearly three years after rioters stormed the U.S. Capitol, the false election conspiracy theories that drove the violent attack remain prevalent on social media and cable news: suitcases filled with ballots, late-night ballot dumps, dead people voting.\n\nExperts warn it will likely be worse in the coming presidential election contest. The safeguards that attempted to counter the bogus claims the last time are eroding, while the tools and systems that create and spread them are only getting stronger.\n\nMany Americans, egged on by former President Donald Trump, have continued to push the unsupported idea that elections throughout the U.S. can\u2019t be trusted. A majority of Republicans (57%) believe Democrat Joe Biden was not legitimately elected president.\n\nMeanwhile, generative artificial intelligence tools have made it far cheaper and easier to spread the kind of misinformation that can mislead voters and potentially influence elections. And social media companies that once invested heavily in correcting the record have shifted their priorities.\n\n\u201cI expect a tsunami of misinformation,\u201d said Oren Etzioni, an artificial intelligence expert and professor emeritus at the University of Washington. \u201cI can\u2019t prove that. I hope to be proven wrong. But the ingredients are there, and I am completely terrified.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nManipulated images and videos surrounding elections are nothing new, but 2024 will be the first U.S. presidential election in which sophisticated AI tools that can produce convincing fakes in seconds are just a few clicks away.\n\nThe fabricated images, videos and audio clips known as deepfakes have started making their way into experimental presidential campaign ads. More sinister versions could easily spread without labels on social media and fool people days before an election, Etzioni said.\n\n\u201cYou could see a political candidate like President Biden being rushed to a hospital,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could see a candidate saying things that he or she never actually said. You could see a run on the banks. You could see bombings and violence that never occurred.\u201d\n\nHigh-tech fakes already have affected elections around the globe, said Larry Norden, senior director of the elections and government program at the Brennan Center for Justice. Just days before Slovakia\u2019s recent elections, AI-generated audio recordings impersonated a liberal candidate discussing plans to raise beer prices and rig the election. Fact-checkers scrambled to identify them as false, but they were shared as real across social media regardless.\n\nThese tools might also be used to target specific communities and hone misleading messages about voting. That could look like persuasive text messages, false announcements about voting processes shared in different languages on WhatsApp, or bogus websites mocked up to look like official government ones in your area, experts said.\n\nFaced with content that is made to look and sound real, \u201ceverything that we\u2019ve been wired to do through evolution is going to come into play to have us believe in the fabrication rather than the actual reality,\u201d said misinformation scholar Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress and the Federal Election Commission are exploring steps to regulate the technology, but they haven\u2019t finalized any rules or legislation. That\u2019s left states to enact the only restrictions so far on political AI deepfakes.\n\nA handful of states have passed laws requiring deepfakes to be labeled or banning those that misrepresent candidates. Some social media companies, including YouTube and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, have introduced AI labeling policies. It remains to be seen whether they will be able to consistently catch violators.\n\nIt was just over a year ago that Elon Musk bought Twitter and began firing its executives, dismantling some of its core features and reshaping the social media platform into what\u2019s now known as X.\n\nSince then, he has upended its verification system, leaving public officials vulnerable to impersonators. He has gutted the teams that once fought misinformation on the platform, leaving the community of users to moderate itself. And he has restored the accounts of conspiracy theorists and extremists who were previously banned.\n\nThe changes have been applauded by many conservatives who say Twitter\u2019s previous moderation attempts amounted to censorship of their views. But pro-democracy advocates argue the takeover has shifted what once was a flawed but useful resource for news and election information into a largely unregulated echo chamber that amplifies hate speech and misinformation.\n\nTwitter used to be one of the \u201cmost responsible\u201d platforms, showing a willingness to test features that might reduce misinformation even at the expense of engagement, said Jesse Lehrich, co-founder of Accountable Tech, a nonprofit watchdog group.\n\n\u201cObviously now they\u2019re on the exact other end of the spectrum,\u201d he said, adding that he believes the company\u2019s changes have given other platforms cover to relax their own policies. X didn\u2019t answer emailed questions from The Associated Press, only sending an automated response.\n\nIn the run-up to 2024, X, Meta and YouTube have together removed 17 policies that protected against hate and misinformation, according to a report from Free Press, a nonprofit that advocates for civil rights in tech and media.\n\nIn June, YouTube announced that while it would still regulate content that misleads about current or upcoming elections, it would stop removing content that falsely claims the 2020 election or other previous U.S. elections were marred by \u201cwidespread fraud, errors or glitches.\u201d The platform said the policy was an attempt to protect the ability to \u201copenly debate political ideas, even those that are controversial or based on disproven assumptions.\u201d\n\nLehrich said even if tech companies want to steer clear of removing misleading content, \u201cthere are plenty of content-neutral ways\u201d platforms can reduce the spread of disinformation, from labeling months-old articles to making it more difficult to share content without reviewing it first.\n\nX, Meta and YouTube also have laid off thousands of employees and contractors since 2020, some of whom have included content moderators.\n\nThe shrinking of such teams, which many blame on political pressure, \u201csets the stage for things to be worse in 2024 than in 2020,\u201d said Kate Starbird, a misinformation expert at the University of Washington.\n\nMeta explains on its website that it has some 40,000 people devoted to safety and security and that it maintains \u201cthe largest independent fact-checking network of any platform.\u201d It also frequently takes down networks of fake social media accounts that aim to sow discord and distrust.\n\n\u201cNo tech company does more or invests more to protect elections online than Meta \u2013 not just during election periods but at all times,\u201d the posting says.\n\nIvy Choi, a YouTube spokesperson, said the platform is \u201cheavily invested\u201d in connecting people to high-quality content on YouTube, including for elections. She pointed to the platform\u2019s recommendation and information panels, which provide users with reliable election news, and said the platform removes content that misleads voters on how to vote or encourages interference in the democratic process.\n\nThe rise of TikTok and other, less regulated platforms such as Telegram, Truth Social and Gab, also has created more information silos online where baseless claims can spread. Some apps that are particularly popular among communities of color and immigrants, such as WhatsApp and WeChat, rely on private chats, making it hard for outside groups to see the misinformation that may spread.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m worried that in 2024, we\u2019re going to see similar recycled, ingrained false narratives but more sophisticated tactics,\u201d said Roberta Braga, founder and executive director of the Digital Democracy Institute of the Americas. \u201cBut on the positive side, I am hopeful there is more social resilience to those things.\u201d\n\nTrump\u2019s front-runner status in the Republican presidential primary is top of mind for misinformation researchers who worry that it will exacerbate election misinformation and potentially lead to election vigilantism or violence.\n\nThe former president still falsely claims to have won the 2020 election.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump has clearly embraced and fanned the flames of false claims about election fraud in the past,\u201d Starbird said. \u201cWe can expect that he may continue to use that to motivate his base.\u201d\n\nWithout evidence, Trump has already primed his supporters to expect fraud in the 2024 election, urging them to intervene to \u201c guard the vote \u201d to prevent vote rigging in diverse Democratic cities. Trump has a long history of suggesting elections are rigged if he doesn\u2019t win and did so before voting in 2016 and 2020.\n\nThat continued wearing away of voter trust in democracy can lead to violence, said Bret Schafer, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Alliance for Securing Democracy, which tracks misinformation.\n\n\u201cIf people don\u2019t ultimately trust information related to an election, democracy just stops working,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a misinformation or disinformation campaign is effective enough that a large enough percentage of the American population does not believe that the results reflect what actually happened, then Jan. 6 will probably look like a warm-up act.\u201d\n\nElection officials have spent the years since 2020 preparing for the expected resurgence of election denial narratives. They\u2019ve dispatched teams to explain voting processes, hired outside groups to monitor misinformation as it emerges and beefed up physical protections at vote-counting centers.\n\nIn Colorado, Secretary of State Jena Griswold said informative paid social media and TV campaigns that humanize election workers have helped inoculate voters against misinformation.\n\n\u201cThis is an uphill battle, but we have to be proactive,\u201d she said. \u201cMisinformation is one of the biggest threats to American democracy we see today.\u201d\n\nMinnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon\u2019s office is spearheading #TrustedInfo2024, a new online public education effort by the National Association of Secretaries of State to promote election officials as a trusted source of election information in 2024.\n\nHis office also is planning meetings with county and city election officials and will update a \u201cFact and Fiction\u201d information page on its website as false claims emerge. A new law in Minnesota will protect election workers from threats and harassment, bar people from knowingly distributing misinformation ahead of elections and criminalize people who non-consensually share deepfake images to hurt a political candidate or influence an election.\n\n\u201cWe hope for the best but plan for the worst through these layers of protections,\u201d Simon said.\n\nIn a rural Wisconsin county north of Green Bay, Oconto County Clerk Kim Pytleski has traveled the region giving talks and presentations to small groups about voting and elections to boost voters\u2019 trust. The county also offers equipment tests in public so residents can observe the process.\n\n\u201cBeing able to talk directly with your elections officials makes all the difference,\u201d she said. \u201cBeing able to see that there are real people behind these processes who are committed to their jobs and want to do good work helps people understand we are here to serve them.\u201d\n\nFernando reported from Chicago. Associated Press writer Christina A. Cassidy in Atlanta contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press\u202freceives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

(AP) \u2014 A North Dakota judge said Wednesday he will decide soon whether to temporarily block a part of the state\u2019s revised abortion laws so doctors can perform the procedure to save a patient\u2019s life or health.\n\nThe request for a preliminary injunction asks state District Court Judge Bruce Romanick to bar the state from enforcing the law against physicians who use their \u201cgood-faith medical judgment\u201d to perform an abortion because of pregnancy complications that could pose \u201ca risk of infection, hemorrhage, high blood pressure, or which otherwise makes continuing a pregnancy unsafe.\u201d\n\nNorth Dakota outlaws all abortions, except in cases where women could face death or a \u201cserious health risk.\u201d People who perform abortions could be charged with a felony under the law, but patients would not.\n\nPhysicians, to mitigate risk of prosecution, \u201cfeel like they must delay offering abortions to their patients until the patients\u2019 health has declined to the point where other physicians could not plausibly disagree that it was necessary to provide an abortion,\u201d Center for Reproductive Rights attorney Meetra Mehdizadeh said.\n\n\u201cPatients and physicians have experienced significant harm,\u201d she said. \u201cFor patients, the denial of their constitutional rights and forced additional health risks; and for physicians, the harm of having the threat of criminal prosecution hanging over their head every time they treat a patient with a medical complication.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe state\u2019s revised abortion laws also provide an exception for pregnancies caused by rape and incest, but only in the first six weeks, before many women know they are pregnant. It also allows for treatment of ectopic and molar pregnancies, which are nonviable situations.\n\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General Dan Gaustad cited the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cseven-month delay\u201d in seeking a preliminary injunction, and he disputed the \u201cgood-faith medical judgment\u201d language. He told the judge the plaintiffs are asking him \u201cto modify and rewrite the statute under the guise of a preliminary injunction.\u201d The law uses \u201dreasonable medical judgment.\u201d\n\nThe Red River Women\u2019s Clinic sued the state last year after the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Dobbs decision, which overturned the court\u2019s landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling establishing a nationwide right to abortion. The lawsuit targeted the state\u2019s since-repealed trigger ban \u2014 a ban designed to go into effect immediately if the court overturned Roe v. Wade \u2014 as unconstitutional. The clinic moved from Fargo to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion is legal.\n\nThe judge granted a preliminary injunction blocking the ban from taking effect last year, which the state Supreme Court upheld in March.\n\nChief Justice Jon Jensen wrote in the court\u2019s March decision that \u201cit is clear the citizens of North Dakota have a right to enjoy and defend life and a right to pursue and obtain safety, which necessarily includes a pregnant woman has a fundamental right to obtain an abortion to preserve her life or her health.\u201d\n\nSoon afterward, North Dakota\u2019s Republican-controlled Legislature passed a bill revising the state\u2019s abortion laws, which Gov. Doug Burgum signed into effect in April.\n\nIn June, the clinic filed an amended complaint, joined by several doctors in obstetrics, gynecology and maternal-fetal medicine. A jury trial is scheduled for August 2024.",

The appeal was expected and the case is likely to ultimately be decided by the Wisconsin Supreme Court.\n\nUrmanski asked that the appeal be heard in the state\u2019s Waukesha-based 2nd District Court of Appeals, where three of the four judges are conservative. Appeals are heard by three-judge panels.\n\nAny appeal of a ruling there would go to the state Supreme Court, where liberals hold a 4-3 majority. The most recently elected liberal justice, Janet Protasiewicz, campaigned as a supporter of abortion rights.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s June 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision legalizing abortion, led to Planned Parenthood stopping abortions in Wisconsin. The group cited the state\u2019s 1849 law, which was widely viewed as banning the procedure.\n\n\n\n\nDemocratic Attorney General Josh Kaul sued to overturn the ban, naming Urmanski in Sheboygan County and prosecutors in Dane and Milwaukee counties as defendants. Those are the counties where Planned Parenthood had clinics that offered abortions.\n\nDane County Circuit Judge Dianne Schlipper ruled in July that the 1849 ban doesn\u2019t use the term \u201cabortion\u201d and that the law therefore only prohibits attacking a woman in an attempt to kill her unborn child. She issued her final order earlier this month, which opened the door for the appeal.\n\nPlanned Parenthood reopened clinics in Madison and Milwaukee that perform abortions soon after the July ruling. A third clinic in Sheboygan is scheduled to reopen next week.\n\nDistrict attorneys in all three counties where the clinics are located, including Urmanski, have said they will abide by the judge\u2019s ruling while the case plays out.\n\nMarquette University Law School polls conducted since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade have shown that a majority of Wisconsin residents opposed that ruling and support legalized abortion.",

        "body": "Repeatedly in recent years, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops has stipulated that \u201cthe threat of abortion remains our preeminent priority.\u201d In the face of recent election setbacks for abortion opponents, leading bishops and their lay allies are reassessing how to move forward with that stance.\n\nThe latest rebuff came Nov. 7 in Ohio, when voters decisively approved a constitutional amendment that ensures access to abortion and other forms of reproductive health care. It was the seventh consecutive state where voters decided to protect abortion access since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the nationwide constitutional right to abortion in June 2022.\n\nThe Ohio result was particularly stinging for abortion opponents, coming in a state where tough anti-abortion measures had been approved by the Republican-controlled legislature.\n\n\u201cToday is a tragic day for women, children, and families in Ohio,\u201d the state\u2019s Catholic bishops said in a joint statement as the outcome became clear.\n\n\u201cWe must look ahead,\u201d the bishops added. \u201cDespite the obstacles this amendment presents, the Catholic Church in Ohio will continue to work for policies that defend the most vulnerable, strengthen the child-parent relationship, and support women in need.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nBrian Hickey, executive director of the Catholic Conference of Ohio, noted that support for the abortion-rights amendment was particularly strong among younger voters, signaling that it could take many years to build an anti-abortion majority in the state\u2019s electorate. Exit polls suggested that more than 75% of voters aged 18 to 29 backed the amendment.\n\n\u201cHow do we reach this next generation of Ohioans?\u201d Hickey asked during an interview with The Associated Press. \u201cWe know there is a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nThe chairman of the U.S. bishops\u2019 Committee on Pro-life Activities, Bishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia, recalled how he and his colleagues celebrated 18 months ago after the Supreme Court \u2014 in its so-called Dobbs decision \u2014 struck down the much-debated Roe v. Wade ruling of 1973. The result was to end the nationwide right to abortion, and leave it to individual states to decide whether to ban it or allow it.\n\n\u201cThere was a moment to celebrate, but we also knew it was only a brief moment, because rightfully this issue is back in the states,\u201d Burbidge said. \u201cThese ballot-measure results are very unsettling.\u201d\n\nBurbidge said the Catholic leadership needed to convey more clearly that it is \u201cpro-women\u201d -- even as it supports state legislation aimed at limiting their options regarding unwanted pregnancies.\n\n\u201cNot even our parishioners are aware of all of the support the Catholic Church will give to single moms in need \u2014 counseling, financial assistance, housing \u2014 so mothers know they are being accompanied,\u201d he told the AP. \u201cWe will be with them every step of the way.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe look at the results, and they are not favorable,\u201d Burbidge added. \u201cWe have a good message to convey. ... Even if it hits some more bumps in the road, some disappointments, eventually we believe that what is true, what is just, will triumph.\u201d\n\n2024 will bring many opportunities for disappointments and triumphs. Abortion is sure to be a key issue in many political contests, and efforts are underway in several states \u2014 including Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Missouri and Nebraska \u2014 to get Ohio-style abortion-rights measures on the ballot.\n\nBurbidge and Hickey said the Catholic leadership, as it moved ahead in the abortion debate, should avoid sounding harsh and punitive. Hickey, for example, suggested that abortion restrictions would receive greater public support if they offered exceptions, perhaps allowing abortions for women impregnated by rape.\n\n\u201cWe need to have those conversations,\u201d Hickey said. \u201cThe Catholic Church is a place for refuge. It\u2019s not a place for condemnation.\u201d\n\nSome Catholic abortion opponents favor an aggressive approach, whether or not it sways voter sentiment.\n\n\u201cThe church will never compromise, it cannot compromise. It will always stand for the truth that every single human life is sacred,\u201d said Brian Burch, president of the conservative advocacy group CatholicVote.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s very clear the public is completely divided on this,\u201d he added. \u201cRecent trends show the public is not willing to go where many pro-life entities had hoped to go in the wake of Dobbs.\u201d\n\nBurch said state legislatures with anti-abortion majorities should avoid punishing women who get abortions. But he approves of penalties against medical personnel who provide abortions, and favors new laws that could punish people for pressuring a woman to get an abortion.\n\n\u201cThe abortion divide has become more heightened because of Dobbs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no question the Democrats will use the issue next year. It\u2019s a political gamble and I hope they\u2019re wrong.\u201d\n\nFrank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, hopes the Democrats do highlight the issue \u2013 and says abortion opponents should engage head-on in the ensuing debate, rather than skirting the issue.\n\n\u201cWe need an honest debate about abortion \u2014 a debate that starts with a clear, objective and public description of what the abortion procedure is,\u201d Pavone says in a strategy memo he\u2019s distributing to political candidates. \u201cAbortion supporters refuse to describe what they defend ... abortion itself is the last thing they want to talk about.\u201d\n\nPavone was a Catholic priest from 1988 until 2022, when the Vatican removed him from the priesthood for \u201cblasphemous communications\u201d on social media, and persistent disobedience of his bishop. Over many years, he had drawn attention for partisan political activities that accompanied his anti-abortion activism.\n\nIn common with Burbidge, Hickey and Burch, Pavone advocates showing compassion for women considering abortion.\n\nBut Catholics who support abortion rights question how this rhetoric can be reconciled with a stance that would deny these women the freedom to choose for themselves how to proceed.\n\n\u201cSolidarity with women \u2014 what does that mean?\u201d asked Jamie Manson, president of Catholics for Choice.\n\n\u201cWomen do not have equality in the church. We\u2019re not allowed to lead, to be ordained,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2018solidarity\u2019 means when you have an entrenched second-class status for women.\u201d\n\nManson would like to see a new kind of conversation within Catholic ranks.\n\n\u201cMany Catholic women have had an abortion \u2014 they have a story to tell,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hoping and pushing for is for Catholic leaders to listen to why women made that choice and have no regrets.\u201d\n\nFor now, the U.S. bishops conference has signaled it will press ahead with existing strategies on abortion. Last month, a week after the abortion-rights amendment was approved in Ohio, the bishops elected Daniel Thomas, the bishop of Toledo, Ohio, to succeed Burbidge in November 2024 as chairman of the Committee on Pro-Life Activities. \n\nThomas had forcefully appealed for Ohioans to defeat the amendment, calling it \u201cextreme, dangerous and unacceptable.\u201d\n\nManson depicted the election of Thomas as \u201cironic,\u201d given that Catholic dioceses in Ohio had spent hundreds of thousands of dollars unsuccessfully opposing the amendment.\n\n\u201cThe Catholic bishops are doubling down on their losing abortion strategy through 2024,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Catholic Church will continue to spend big in elections \u2014 and they will continue to lose.\u201d \n\nAssociated Press religion coverage receives support through the AP\u2019s collaboration with The Conversation US, with funding from Lilly Endowment Inc.

        "body": "VANCOUVER, Wash. (AP) \u2014 Over the last six years, blood center employee Dylan Smith was often asked how frequently he gave blood himself. His answer was always the same: As a gay man, he couldn\u2019t.\n\nThat changed this month.\n\nThanks to new federal guidelines finalized in May, gay and bisexual men in monogamous relationships can now donate at many blood centers around the country without abstaining from sex. \n\nBloodworks Northwest, where Smith works as a donor services supervisor, adopted the change on Dec. 6. He and his partner gave blood for the first time the next day. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really emotionally difficult just to explain every single time the reason why,\u201d said Smith, 28. \u201cTo be able to finally step up and support the mission that I really have just believed in since I started here just makes my heart feel so happy.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nThe new U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines are the latest step in a yearslong effort to reverse restrictions that were designed to protect the blood supply from HIV, but which were increasingly criticized as discriminatory following scientific advances that allowed better detection of the virus.\n\nIn 2015, the FDA dropped the lifetime ban on donations from men who have sex with men and replaced it with a one-year abstinence requirement. The agency shortened the abstinence period to three months in 2020 after donations plummeted during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAP correspondent Donna Warder reports.\n\nThe American Red Cross, which accounts for about 40% of blood and blood component donations in the U.S., began implementing the new guidance in August. \n\nAbout half of the 16 independent blood bank organizations that are members of the Alliance for Community Transfusion Services have rolled out the new guidelines, with more expected next year, the organization said.\n\n\u201cIt is going to take time,\u201d said Benjamin Prijatel, president of Shepeard Community Blood Center in Augusta, Georgia. \u201cBlood centers and health professionals are going to have to put forth the effort to engage and educate this community in order to overcome years of distrust. That\u2019s the only way this rule change will translate into additional donations.\u201d\n\nThe change puts the emphasis on sexual activity rather than on sexual orientation. All potential donors are screened with a new questionnaire evaluating their HIV risk based on sexual behavior, partners and other factors that can contribute to the spread of blood-borne infections, such as intravenous drug use or recent tattoos or piercings. \n\nPotential donors who report having anal sex with new partners in the last three months are barred from giving until a later date, and anyone who has ever tested positive for HIV will continue to be ineligible. Those taking pills to prevent HIV through sexual contact are still barred until three months after their last dose; the medications, known as PrEP, can delay the detection of the virus, the FDA said.\n\nDonated blood is then tested for HIV, hepatitis C, syphilis and other infectious diseases.\n\nBloodworks Northwest, which supplies blood to more than 90 hospitals in the region, isn\u2019t keeping track of how many newly eligible donors are coming in, said Dr. Kirsten Alcorn, the nonprofit\u2019s co-chief medical officer. But workers have heard plenty of stories from people excited to give.\n\n\u201cIt feels very meaningful to many of them to now be able to contribute to somebody\u2019s survival,\u201d Alcorn said.\n\nBloodworks executive Aaron Posey, whose own life was saved by a transfusion when he fell down a set of stairs and broken glass sliced an artery, welcomed the new guidance. He said hospitals and patients need access to a new pool of donors.\n\n\u201cHaving always witnessed a shortage in the blood supply, it has at times been very frustrating,\u201d said Posey, who first donated blood during the pandemic when the abstinence period was cut to three months.\n\nSmith learned of the restrictions on gay men giving blood when he was screened while trying to donate his freshman year of college in 2013. The rules blindsided him, he said. It was a long time to wait before he could finally donate with his partner and other friends.\n\n\u201cJust being able to see them donating next to me, smiling next to me ... meant so much,\u201d Smith said.",

        "body": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A federal judge hearing a challenge to a transgender health care ban for minors and restrictions for adults noted Thursday that Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis repeatedly spread false information about doctors mutilating children\u2019s genitals even though there\u2019s been no such documented cases.\n\nThe law was sold as defending children from mutilation when it is actually about preventing trans children from getting health care, Judge Robert Hinkle said to Mohammad Jazil, a lawyer for the state.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m analyzing the governor\u2019s motivation, what should I make of these statements?\u201d Hinkle asked. \u201cThis seems to be more than just hyperbole.\u201d\n\nHinkle said he will rule sometime in the new year on whether the Legislature, the Department of Health and presidential candidate DeSantis deliberately targeted transgender people through the new law. He raised some skepticism about the state\u2019s motivation as lawyers gave their closing arguments.\n\nThe trial is challenging Florida\u2019s ban on medical treatment for transgender children, such as hormone therapy or puberty blockers, a law DeSantis touted while seeking the presidency. The law also places restrictions on adult trans care.\n\n\n\n\nJazil said the motivation behind the law was simply public safety in an area that needs more oversight and can have permanent consequences.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about treating a medical condition; it\u2019s not about targeting transgender individuals,\u201d Jazil said.\n\nJazil added that if the state was targeting transgender people, it could have banned all treatment for adults and children. Hinkle quickly replied that Jazil would have trouble defending such a law.\n\nHinkle, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, has temporarily blocked enforcement of the law as it pertains to minors, pending the outcome of the trial. The lawsuit also challenges restrictions placed on adult trans care, which have been allowed to take effect during the trial.\n\nAt least 22 states have now enacted laws restricting or banning gender-affirming medical care for transgender minors, and many of those states face lawsuits. Courts have issued mixed rulings, with the nation\u2019s first law, in Arkansas, struck down by a federal judge who said the ban on care violated the due process rights of transgender youth and their families. \n\nEnforcement is blocked in two states besides Florida, and enforcement is currently allowed in or set to go into effect soon in seven other states.\n\nThomas Redburn, a lawyer representing trans adults and the families of trans children, said DeSantis and the Legislature have shown a pattern of targeting transgender people. He listed other recent laws that affect the community, including restrictions on pronoun use in schools, the teaching of gender identification in schools, restrictions on public bathrooms and the prohibition of trans girls from playing girls sports.",

The Church\u2019s main argument centered around the issue of raising children, claiming they are being treated as \u201caccessories\u201d and \u201ccompanion pets\u201d for gay couples.\n\n\u201cWe always listen to the opinions of the Church with respect,\u201d Marinakis said. \u201cBut at the same time, we are implementing our policy, and will listen to the views of society, civil society, the citizenry, institutions, and parties in total.\u201d\n\nThe Church argues that extending marriage rights would create a legal obligation to eventually follow up with parental rights under international rights obligations that Greece has signed up to. \n\n\n\n\n\u201cThe position of the Church of Greece remains that children have an innate need and therefore a right to grow up with a male father and a female mother. No amount of social modernization and no amount of political correctness can bypass (this),\u201d the Church circular said.\n\n\u201cChildren are not companion pets for those who wish to feel like a guardian, and are not \u2018accessories\u2019 to formalize or make same-sex cohabitation socially acceptable,\u201d it added. \n\nThe comment drew widespread attention in the Greek news media.\n\nOpinion polls suggest Greeks are evenly divided on the issue of same-sex marriage, but opposed to extending full parental rights to gay couples.\n\nSame-sex marriage is legal in 34 countries globally, according to the Human Rights Campaign Foundation, a U.S. association created to monitor discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. None of the countries on that list are majority Orthodox Christian like Greece, although several have legalized civil partnerships in recent years. \n\nProminent members of Greece\u2019s governing conservatives have publicly expressed support as well as opposition to the government\u2019s commitment while left-wing and center-left opposition parties are generally supportive. \n\nThe country\u2019s left-wing opposition leader, Stefanos Kasselakis, married his male partner in New York in October, several weeks after winning a party leadership election.\n\nGreece legalized same-sex civil partnerships in 2015.",

(AP) \u2014 Authorities in central Florida issued an arrest warrant Sunday for a 39-year-old man accused of fatally shooting another man at a shopping mall two days before Christmas in which police say the victim was \u201ctargeted.\u201d\n\nAs of Sunday afternoon, the suspect hadn\u2019t been located, and the Ocala Police Department was offering a $5,000 award for any information leading to his arrest. The arrest warrant was for premeditated first-degree murder and attempted premeditated first-degree murder, the police department said on social media.\n\nOcala Police Chief Mike Balken told reporters Saturday evening that the victim was killed after he was shot multiple times in a common area at Paddock Mall in Ocala, located about 80 miles (127 kilometers) northwest of Orlando. \n\nA woman also was shot in the leg. She was treated at a local hospital and expected to recover, Balken said.\n\nThe suspect fled the scene and left behind the firearm, Balken said.\n\n\n\n\nOcala police posted photos overnight of a person of interest that appear to be taken from a mall security camera. The three images show a male with a red cap and dark clothing. Balken previously said the suspect wore a hooded sweatshirt and a mask partially covering his face. \n\nOn Sunday, the police department urged a person who took the suspect\u2019s hat from the crime scene to turn it over to investigators or they would be charged with tampering with evidence.\n\n\u201cThat hat may contain valuable DNA evidence, and we need it back,\u201d the Ocala Police Department said on social media. \u201cWe urge you to do the right thing and come forward immediately. Time is of the essence.\u201d \n\nPolice arrived at the mall around 3:40 p.m. Saturday after a call of multiple shots being fired at the mall. \n\n\u201cOfficers immediately made entry into the mall (and) ultimately discovered that this was not what we would consider an active shooter,\u201d Balken told reporters.\n\nThe attack was likely a \u201ctargeted act of violence\u201d against the man, Balken said. \n\nSeveral other mall patrons suffered injuries during the shooting, with one person having chest pain and another reporting a broken arm, police said. \n\nPolice have asked the public for assistance by submitting mobile phone video of the shooting scene. \n\nThe mall\u2019s corporate owner, WPG, said in a statement that they were working with the Ocala Police Department in the investigation of what happened. The mall was closed Sunday, the day before Christmas.\n\n\u201cWe are deeply saddened by this tragedy. Our thoughts are with all those involved,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe safety of our guests, retailers and employees is our top priority.\u201d\n\nThe mall has dozens of stores, including J.C. Penney and Foot Locker.\n\nCalvin and Diana Amos, who were shopping in the J.C. Penney store, told the Ocala Star-Banner that they evacuated the store quickly once they figured out what was going on.

President Petr Pavel and speakers of both houses of Parliament attended a Mass for the victims at St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague, the country\u2019s biggest, which was packed. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all still in a shock in our own ways,\u201d Prague Archbishop Jan Graubner said. \u201cWe need to clearly condemn what happened but we also need to look into the future.\u201d\n\n\u201cNobody should be left alone in these tough moments,\u201d Charles University rector Milena Kralickova said in her remarks toward the end of the Mass. The shooting occurred inside the university\u2019s Faculty of Arts on Thursday. Twenty-five other people were wounded before the gunman killed himself. \n\nPolice and prosecutors said they have evidence the 24-year-old shooter also killed his father earlier in the day and a man and a baby in Prague last week.\n\n\n\n\nSimilar religious services were held in other cities and towns, while Christmas markets in a number of places were closed or reduced their programs amid boosted security measures.\n\nA sea of candles was shining at an impromptu memorial for the victims in front of the university headquarters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a horrible experience for us all but it still can\u2019t be compared with what the victims had to experience at the time of the attack and what their dear ones have to experience now,\u201d said Milos Vystrcil, speaker of the Senate who came to light a candle.\n\n\u201cI think that to help them at this point we express our support and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all doing now.\u201d\n\nThe 14 fatalities are being slowly identified.

Investigators do not suspect a link to any extremist ideology or groups.

        "body": "PORTLAND, Maine (AP) \u2014 Police who declined to confront an Army reservist in the weeks before he killed 18 people in Maine\u2019s deadliest mass shooting feared that doing so would \u201cthrow a stick of dynamite on a pool of gas,\u201d according to video released Friday by law enforcement.\n\nThe video, which was released to the Portland Press Herald and then sent to The Associated Press, documents a Sept. 16 call between Sagadahoc County Sheriff\u2019s Sgt. Aaron Skolfield and Army Reserve Capt. Jeremy Reamer. Skolfield was following up with Reamer about the potential threat posed by Robert Card, 40, who carried out the Oct. 25 attacks at a bowling alley and a restaurant. He was found dead two days later of a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\nMilitary officials alerted police in September that Card had been hospitalized in July after exhibiting erratic behavior while training, that he still had access to weapons and that he had threatened to \u201cshoot up\u201d an Army reserve center in Saco, a city in southern Maine. The sheriff\u2019s department responded by briefly staking out the Saco facility and going to Card\u2019s home in Bowdoin for what Reamer described as a \u201cwelfare check.\u201d \n\n\u201cThe only thing I would ask is if you could just document it,\u201d Reamer said. \u201cJust say, \u2019He was there, he was uncooperative. But we confirmed that he was alive and breathing.\u2019 And then we can go from there. That\u2019s, from my end here, all we\u2019re really looking for.\u201d\n\nSkolfield mentioned Maine\u2019s yellow flag law, which can be used to remove guns from potentially dangerous people, after Reamer said Card had refused medical treatment after his hospitalization.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cSo that, obviously, is a hurdle we have to deal with. But at the same time, we don\u2019t want to throw a stick of dynamite on a pool of gas, either \u2014 make things worse,\u201d he said.\n\nReamer expressed similar concerns. \u201cI\u2019m a cop myself,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, I don\u2019t want you guys to get hurt or do anything that would put you guys in a compromising position.\u201d\n\nAuburn City Councilor Leroy Walker Sr., whose son Joseph Walker was killed in the shootings, expressed frustration with police after seeing the video. Joseph Walker was the manager of Schemengees Bar & Grill, where part of the attack took place.\n\n\u201cI would like to know what we train these people to do. Is it just to deliver mail? Or stop innocent people that may be driving 11 miles (per hour) over the speed limit?\u201d Walker said in a text message, noting that watching the video made him \u201csick.\u201d\n\nIn the video, Skolfield referred to the Cards as \u201ca big family in this area,\u201d and said he didn\u2019t want to publicize that police were visiting the home. He told Reamer he would reach out to Card\u2019s brother, Ryan, to ensure family members had taken Card\u2019s guns, and a second video shows an officer at the father\u2019s home. After Card\u2019s father said he hadn\u2019t spoken with Ryan in several days, the officer said he would try again later.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to make sure Robert doesn\u2019t do anything foolish at all,\u201d he said.\n\nA report released last week by Sagadahoc Sheriff Joel Merry made clear that local law enforcement knew months before the attack that Card\u2019s mental health was deteriorating. Police were aware of reports that he was paranoid, hearing voices, experiencing psychotic episodes and possibly dealing with schizophrenia.\n\nMerry and Lewiston city officials declined to comment on the release of the videos. \n\nBut Stephanie Sherman, an attorney who has represented several families of survivors of the 2022 mass shooting at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, said the videos show officers took a disturbingly casual approach to the threat Card posed. Police had more than enough information to take to a local judge, she said. \n\n\u201cThere was a history of problems within the Army, there was a history of institutionalization. The police knew that this person was having hallucinations,\u201d Sherman said. \u201cSo there was a whole batch of problems that they quickly could have gotten an order to confiscate the guns, and even possibly put the person in custody. Not criminal custody, but some kind of psychiatric hold.\u201d \n\nSherman said, however, that police tend to rely on immunity, which historically has shielded them from liability when they avoid taking an action such as placing a person in custody. \n\nA former New York Police Department detective sergeant who reviewed the videos for the AP said the events preceding the shooting illustrate the difficulty in applying Maine\u2019s yellow flag law. Lax laws about removing weapons from dangerous people is a problem in numerous states, said Felipe Rodriguez, an adjunct professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\n\n\u201cThe laws are just too convoluted and they are working against each other. That\u2019s the biggest problem we have,\u201d Rodriguez said.\n\nDan Flannery, the director of the Begun Center for Violence Prevention Research and Education at Case Western Reserve University, cautioned that only so much about a police investigation can be gleaned from a few minutes of video.\n\n\u201cThere is always context, there is the issue of what is the training and protocol within the division,\u201d Flannery said. \u201cViolent behavior is unfortunately one of the most difficult things to predict.\u201d\n\nBut attorneys for shooting victims\u2019 families said the footage supports a pattern of police ignoring clear warning signs about Card in the weeks prior to the shooting. One of the attorneys, Ben Gideon of Auburn, said \u201cwatching that footage, knowing what happened approximately six weeks later, is chilling and surreal.\u201d\n\nThe attorneys said they are looking forward to an independent Army inspector general\u2019s full accounting of the events leading up to the shootings. Some of the information they\u2019ve gathered so far, including the video released Friday, is \u201chighly concerning,\u201d said Travis Brennan, another attorney for the families.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one example of many of system failures. There is no question here that this is an individual who had overt warning signs,\u201d Brennan said.\n\nThe last patient of 13 who were admitted to Central Maine Medical Center after the shooting has been released, hospital representatives said Friday.\n\nIn addition to the inspector general\u2019s investigation, Gov. Janet Mills appointed an an independent commission led by a former state chief justice to review all aspects of the tragedy. \n\nThe actions of authorities ahead of and during mass shootings have come under increasing scrutiny. Last year, the Air Force was ordered to pay more than $230 million  in damages to survivors and victims\u2019 families for failing to flag a conviction that might have kept the gunman in a 2017 church shooting in Texas from legally buying the weapon he used in the attack. \n\nAfter a gunman fatally shot 19 children and two teachers at the school in Uvalde last year, state lawmakers issued a scathing report faulting law enforcement at every level with failing \u201cto prioritize saving innocent lives over their own safety.\u201d Several officers lost their jobs over the halting and haphazard response, and a state prosecutor is still considering whether to bring criminal charges. ___\n\nRamer reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

        "body": "Worried about his mother\u2019s health, Jacob Mabil tried for months to persuade her to let him start the process that would take her from a sprawling refugee camp where she had spent almost a decade after fleeing violence in South Sudan.\n\nHe wanted her to come live with him and his young family in the U.S. But before she would agree, she asked for a promise: that he would one day also bring the granddaughters she had raised since they were babies.\n\nMabil, now 44, said he would do everything he could. But it turned out that he was allowed to petition only for immediate family members. Though his mom joined him in suburban Fort Worth, Texas, in 2020, his nieces remained in Africa.\n\n\u201cThat always killed me,\u201d said Mabil, whose own childhood was ripped apart by civil war in Sudan.\n\nAs the U.S. government transforms the way refugees are being resettled, Mabil and his family now have hope that they will be reunited with two of his nieces, who soon turn 18 and 19. The Biden administration opened the application process this month that lets Americans who have formed groups to privately sponsor refugees request the specific person they want to bring to the U.S.\n\n\n\n\nWhen he was just 8, Mabil was forced to run for his life as soldiers came into his village in what is now South Sudan, setting it on fire as they killed people. He became part of the group of children known as the \u201clost boys,\u201d who spent years on their own and walked hundreds of miles to flee violence.\n\nMabil, who didn\u2019t even know his mother was alive until shortly after he arrived in the U.S. in his early 20s, said he wants his sister\u2019s daughters to have the same opportunities that he has had.\n\nTraditionally, resettlement agencies have placed refugees in communities, but the push to add private sponsorship as well has come as President Joe Biden works to restore a program that was decimated under former President Donald Trump. The launch at the start of 2023 of the State Department\u2019s Welcome Corps program, which allows everyday Americans the chance to form their own groups to privately sponsor refugees, came after a similar endeavor that let U.S. citizens sponsor Afghans or Ukrainians.\n\n\u201cIn many ways it is, I think, one of the most important things that the U.S. resettlement program has ever done,\u201d said Sasha Chanoff, founder and CEO of RefugePoint, a Boston-based nonprofit that helps refugees. \u201cIt will allow families who are in desperate need to reunite to do so.\u201d\n\nWith the U.S. hoping to bring in 125,000 refugees this fiscal year, the use of private sponsors expands the capacity of the existing system, said Welcome Corps spokeswoman Monna Kashfi said. She added that the opportunity to apply to sponsor a specific refugee has been greatly anticipated.\n\n\u201cWe have heard all throughout the year from people who wanted to know ... when they could submit an application to sponsor someone that they know,\u201d she said.\n\nMabil, his wife and his mother have already joined two family friends to form their own sponsor group to start the process to bring over his two nieces, who were placed in a boarding school when their grandmother left Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya for the U.S. One is set to graduate soon and the other has returned to the camp after graduating.\n\nChanoff said that unaccompanied girls are often \u201cin extraordinary danger\u201d at the camp and regularly kidnapped and sold into marriage.\n\nMabil\u2019s wife, Akuot Leek, 33, is also from South Sudan and spent her childhood traveling from place to place with her family to try to escape violence. She wants the young women to have the same freedom that she had to choose what to do with their lives.\n\nLeek and Mabil began dating after meeting at a wedding in the U.S. and both are college graduates who now work in finance.\n\nMabil was one of about 20,000 youths who joined an odyssey that took them first to Ethiopia, where they spent about three years before a war there forced them to flee again. The survivors eventually made it to Kakuma, where Mabil spent almost a decade before coming to the U.S.\n\n\u201cThey had survived bullets and bombs and wild animal attacks and things that you and I can\u2019t imagine to get to Kakuma camp,\u201d said Chanoff, who met Mabil at the camp.\n\nLeek and Mabil say that once his nieces are settled in Texas, they may work to bring over other family members.\n\nMabil\u2019s mother, Adeng Ajang, said living with her son and daughter-in-law and four grandchildren in their comfortable home has made her very happy. Now, the only stress she has in her life is worrying about her granddaughters.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult to leave them,\u201d said Ajang as her daughter-in-law translated from the Dinka language. \u201cIt was hard.\u201d\n\nAjang said talks to her granddaughters on the phone often. \u201cSometimes we talk and then we will start to cry,\u201d she said.\n\nFor Mabil, he\u2019s excited and nervous to start the process. \u201cThis is my last chance,\u201d he said.\n\nVideo journalist Kendria LaFleur contributed to this report.",

        "body": "HUIXTLA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 Christmas Day meant the same as any other day for thousands of migrants walking through southern Mexico: more trudging under a hot sun. \n\nThere were no presents, and Christmas Eve dinner was a sandwich, a bottle of water and a banana handed out by a local church to some of the migrants in the town of \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n, in the southern state of Chiapas, which borders Guatemala.\n\nMigrants spent Christmas night sleeping on a scrap of cardboard or plastic stretched out under an awning or tent, or the bare ground. \n\nIn the morning, it was waking as usual at 4 a.m., to get an early start and avoid the worst of the heat, walking to the next town, Huixtla, 20 miles (30 kilometers) away.\n\nKarla Ram\u00edrez, a migrant from Honduras who was traveling with other adults and four children, got to \u00c1lvaro Obreg\u00f3n too late Sunday to get any of the food being given out by the church. So they had to buy whatever little they could afford.\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt was sad: we have never, ever been in the street before,\u201d Ram\u00edrez said. \u201cOur Christmas dinner was some mortadella, butter and tomato, with a tortilla.\u201d\n\nMariela Amaya\u2019s seven-year-old son didn\u2019t understand why they had to spend Christmas this way. Amaya, also from Honduras, tugged the hand of her tired, recalcitrant son as they walked.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t understand why we have to do this to get a better life,\u201d Amaya said. Nor did the governments of Mexico and the United States, she said. \n\n\u201cWhy can\u2019t they help us? We need their help,\u201d she said.\n\nWhat little help there was came from local families, one of whom gave out tamales \u2014 traditional seasonal fare \u2014 and water to the passing migrants.\n\nThe migrants included single adults but also entire families, all eager to reach the U.S. border, angry and frustrated at having to wait weeks or months in the nearby city of Tapachula for documents that might allow them to continue their journey.\n\nMexico claims it doesn\u2019t give out transit visas, but migrants keep hoping to get some sort of document so they could at least take buses to the border.\n\n\u201cThis journey has been really hard for us migrants. We need the (Mexican) immigration office and the government to have some pity on us, and give us a safe conduct pass,\u201d said Jessica Garc\u00eda, a migrant from Venezuela.\n\nMexico says it detected 680,000 migrants moving through the country in the first 11 months of 2023.\n\nAt around 6,000 people, the migrant caravan that set out Sunday was the largest one since June 2022, when a similarly sized group departed Tapachula. \n\nAnd like the 2022 caravan \u2014 which started as U.S. President Joe Biden hosted leaders in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas \u2014 this year\u2019s Christmas caravan came a few days before U.S. officials are to meet with their Mexican counterparts in Mexico City to explore ways of stemming the number of migrants showing up at the U.S. southwest border.\n\nThe Mexican government has already said it is willing to help try to block migrants from crossing Mexico; the government had little choice, afte r U.S. officials briefly closed two vital Texas railway border crossings, claiming they were overwhelmed by processing migrants.\n\nThat put a chokehold on freight moving from Mexico to the United States, as well as grain needed to feed Mexican livestock moving south. The rail crossings have since been reopened, but the message was clear.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to arrive in Mexico City Wednesday to hammer out new agreements to control the surge of migrants seeking entry into the United States. The U.S. delegation will also include Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.\n\nThis month, as many as 10,000 migrants were arrested per day at the U.S. southwest border. \n\nIn May, Mexico agreed to take in migrants from countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba who had been turned away by the U.S. for not following rules that provided new legal pathways to asylum and other forms of migration.\n\nBut that deal, aimed at curbing a post-pandemic jump in migration, appears to be insufficient as numbers rise once again, disrupting bilateral trade and stoking anti-migrant sentiment among conservative voters in the U.S.\n\nArrests for illegal crossing topped 2 million in each of the U.S. government\u2019s last two fiscal years, reflecting technological changes that have made it easier for migrants to leave home to escape poverty, natural disasters, political repression and organized crime.\n\nFollow AP\u2019s coverage of Latin America and the Caribbean at https://apnews.com/hub/latin-america",

        "body": "UPDATE: Migrant caravan in southern Mexico marks Christmas Day by trudging onward\n\nTAPACHULA, Mexico (AP) \u2014 A sprawling caravan of migrants from Central America, Venezuela, Cuba and other countries trekked through Mexico on Sunday, heading toward the U.S. border. The procession came just days before Secretary of State Antony Blinken arrives in Mexico City to hammer out new agreements to control the surge of migrants seeking entry into the United States.\n\nThe caravan, estimated at around 6,000 people, many of them families with young children, is the largest in more than a year, a clear indication that joint efforts by the Biden administration and President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s government to deter migration are falling short. \n\nThe Christmas Eve caravan departed from the city of Tapachula, near the country\u2019s southern border with Guatemala. Security forces looked on in what appeared to be a repeat of past tactics when authorities waited for the marchers to tire out and then offered them a form of temporary legal status that is used by many to continue their journey northward. \n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been waiting here for three or four months without an answer,\u201d said Cristian Rivera, traveling alone, having left his wife and child in his native Honduras. \u201cHopefully with this march there will be a change and we can get the permission we need to head north.\u201d\n\n\n\n\nL\u00f3pez Obrador in May agreed to take in migrants from countries such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba turned away by the U.S. for not following rules that provided new legal pathways to asylum and other forms of migration.\n\nBut that deal, aimed at curbing a post-pandemic jump in migration, appears to be insufficient as the number of migrants once again surges, disrupting bilateral trade and stoking anti-migrant sentiment among conservative voters in the U.S.\n\nThis month, as many as 10,000 migrants were arrested per day at the U.S. southwest border. Meanwhile, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had to suspend cross-border rail traffic in the Texas cities of Eagle Pass and El Paso as migrants were riding atop freight trains.\n\nArrests for illegal crossing topped 2 million in each of the U.S. government\u2019s last two fiscal years, reflecting technological changes that have made it easier for migrants to leave home to escape poverty, natural disasters, political repression and organized crime.\n\nOn Friday, L\u00f3pez Obrador said he was willing to work again with the U.S. to address concerns about migration. But he also urged the Biden administration to ease sanctions on leftist governments in Cuba and Venezuela \u2014 where about 20% of 617,865 migrants encountered nationwide in October and November hail from \u2014 and send more aid to developing countries in Latin America and beyond. \n\n\u201cThat is what we are going to discuss, it is not just contention,\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador said at a press briefing Friday following a phone conversation the day before with President Joe Biden to pave the way for the high level U.S. delegation.\n\nThe U.S. delegation, which will meet the Mexican president on Wednesday, will also include Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas and White House homeland security adviser Liz Sherwood-Randall.\n\nMexico\u2019s ability to assist the U.S. may be limited, however. In December, the government halted a program to repatriate and transfer migrants inside Mexico due to a lack of funds. So far this year, Mexico has detected more than 680,000 migrants living illegally in the country, while the number of foreigners seeking asylum in the country has reached a record 137,000. \n\nSunday\u2019s caravan was the largest since June 2022, when a similarly sized group departed as Biden hosted leaders in Los Angeles for the Summit of the Americas. Another march departed Mexico in October, coinciding with a summit organized by L\u00f3pez Obrador to discuss the migration crisis with regional leaders. A month later, 3,000 migrants blocked for more than 30 hours the main border crossing with Guatemala. \n\nAssociated Press writers Joshua Goodman in Miami and Maria Verza in Mexico City contributed to this report.\n\nhttps://apnews.com/hub/migration",
